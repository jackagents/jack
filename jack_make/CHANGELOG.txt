2022-05-01 v0.2.0
    - Tool redeveloped in Rust as an experiment into feasibility.
    - Add support for tactics, services, parameter mapping in plans and actions
    - Support for plans with conditions

2021-02-11 v0.1.1
    - Remove onInit(...) from Agent and Team template files, pre-existing JACK projects can be
      updated by removing the onInit(...) stubs from the *impl.h/cpp files.
    - Add support for parsing *.jackresource files in jack-make and generating resource code
    - Add maintenance goal support to *.jackagent files as an array of goal and resource objects.
    - Fix: Plan effects being code-generated with a const BeliefContext. Effects must mutate the
      BeliefContext to simulate the effects of completing the plan. Old projects must update their
      plan *impl.h/cpp files that utilise effects to remove the const qualifier from the
      BeliefContext parameter.
    - Fix crash on attempting to generate on empty projects attempting to access non-available files
    - Improve whitespacing of generated code layout
    - Ensure resources are initialized before agents thay may potentially use the resource
    - Removed unused "this" pointer in action handling lambdas causing warnings on GCC/Clang
