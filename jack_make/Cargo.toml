# \note https://docs.rs/getrandom/latest/getrandom/#webassembly-support
# the wasm32-unknown-unknown target (i.e. the target used by
# wasm-pack) is not automatically supported since, from the target name alone,
# we cannot deduce which JavaScript interface is in use (or if JavaScript is
# available at all).
#
# Instead, if the js Cargo feature is enabled, this crate will assume that you
# are building for an environment containing JavaScript, and will call the
# appropriate methods. Both web browser (main window and Web Workers) and
# Node.js environments are supported, invoking the methods described above using
# the wasm-bindgen toolchain.
